## 📖 About The Project

Luxly is an open-source, self-hostable platform designed to bridge the gap between static study materials and dynamic collaboration. It combines the real-time editing capabilities of modern tools like Google Docs with the power of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

Users can upload heavy PDF documents or video lectures, which are processed in the background to generate vector embeddings. These embeddings allow users to "chat" with their study materials while collaborating with peers in a shared, real-time editor environment.

Unlike simple wrapper applications, Luxly is built as a **distributed system** using a microservices-based monorepo architecture, prioritizing scalability, data sovereignty, and performance.

## 🏗 Architecture

Luxly operates on a modular architecture designed for high throughput and fault tolerance:

- **Ingestion Engine:** Uploaded files (PDF/Video) are stored in **MinIO (S3)**. A message is sent to a **Redis (Valkey)** queue, where a dedicated **Worker Service** picks up the job, extracts text, and generates vector embeddings using OpenAI, storing them in **PostgreSQL (pgvector)**.
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Utilizing **WebSockets** and **CRDTs (Y.js)** via a dedicated **Collab Service**, ensuring conflict-free editing even with multiple active users.
- **Secure Auth:** A custom JWT-based authentication system featuring **Refresh Token Rotation**, **HttpOnly Cookies**, and split identity management for robust security.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This project uses a modern, high-performance tech stack managed within a **Bun Workspace** monorepo.

### Core & Infrastructure

- **Monorepo:** Bun Workspaces
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
- **Reverse Proxy:** Traefik
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict)

### Backend Services (NestJS)

- **API Service:** REST endpoints, Auth, File Uploads.
- **Worker Service:** Background job processing (PDF parsing, Embeddings).
- **Collab Service:** WebSocket server (Hocuspocus) for real-time sync.
- **Queue/Cache:** Valkey (High-performance Redis fork) & BullMQ.
- **Storage:** MinIO (S3 Compatible Object Storage).

### Data & AI

- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16 (with `pgvector` extension).
- **ORM:** Prisma (Multi-file schema structure).
- **AI/ML:** LangChain (Text Splitters), OpenAI API.

### Frontend (Next.js 15)

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router).
- **Editor:** Tiptap (Headless) + Y.js.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui.
- **State:** React Query + Zustand.
